# Welcome to the Sorting Visualizer!

Welcome to my sorting visualizer! This app allows you to visualize and compare different sorting algorithms in action. You can generate new arrays of different sizes and choose from a variety of sorting algorithms to see how they perform on different inputs. Whether you're a seasoned programmer or just starting out, this tool is a great way to learn about and understand how different sorting algorithms work. You can access it here (use Google Chrome!): https://malhar2805.github.io/Sorting-Visualizer/
